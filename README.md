# Regional Sales Analysis In B2K (Unlocking Growth Opportunities)

## Introduction
**In 2022, Vertex Distributors‚Äîa mid-sized U.S. wholesaler‚Äîfaced a critical dilemma: despite steady sales, profitability fluctuated wildly across regions. The leadership team struggled to answer:**

* Why did California outperform Texas by 40% despite similar marketing spend?

* Why did January sales plummet annually, while May-June spiked?

* Which products or channels hid untapped margin potential?

**This project transformed 5 years of fragmented sales data into actionable insights, empowering Vertex to optimize regional strategies, boost margins by 15% YoY, and align inventory with seasonal demand.**

## üîç Project Overview
### Problem Statement
* Inconsistent revenue/profit across U.S. regions.

* Lack of visibility into seasonal trends, top SKUs, and channel profitability.

* Goal: Identify growth levers through historical data analysis.

### Business Questions Addressed
* Which regions, products, and channels drive the highest profitability?

* How can we mitigate seasonal revenue swings?

* Where should we allocate resources for maximum ROI?

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
#### **Data Pipeline**
#### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Cleaned and merged 6 raw tables (sales, customers, products, budgets, etc.).

* Engineered key features: profit_margin_pct, order_month_name, us_region.

* Identified outliers (e.g., 2017 revenue drop) and correlations (price vs. profit: 0.79).

#### Interactive Dashboard (Preview)

* Built in Power BI with dynamic filters (region, product, time).

* Visualized trends via choropleth maps, heatmaps, and scatter plots.

## üí° Key Insights
### Insight	Impact
* Top Products (#26 & #25 drive 25% of revenue)	Focus R&D and marketing on high-margin SKUs.
* Wholesale (54% sales) vs. Export (38% margins)	Balance volume vs. profitability in channel strategy.
* California (7.6K orders, $230M) vs. Northeast (lowest sales)	Replicate CA‚Äôs success in underperforming regions.
* January slump (-30% vs. annual avg.)	Launch targeted promotions to smooth cash flow.

## üöÄ Recommendations
* Seasonal Campaigns: Boost Q1 promotions to counter January lows.

* SKU Rationalization: Phase out low-margin products (e.g., #1‚Äì4).

* Channel Incentives: Partner with Export clients for higher margins.

* Regional Playbook: Expand California‚Äôs strategies to the Midwest.
