## üîç Project Overview
### Problem Statement
* Inconsistent revenue/profit across U.S. regions.

* Lack of visibility into seasonal trends, top SKUs, and channel profitability.

* Identify growth levers through historical data analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
#### **Data Pipeline**
#### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Cleaned and merged 6 raw tables (sales, customers, products, budgets, etc.).

* Engineered key features: profit_margin_pct, order_month_name, us_region.

* Identified outliers (e.g., 2017 revenue drop) and correlations (price vs. profit: 0.79).

#### Interactive Dashboard (Preview)

* Built in Power BI with dynamic filters (region, product, time).

* Visualized trends via choropleth maps, heatmaps, and scatter plots.

## üí° Key Insights
### Insight	Impact
* Top Products (#26 & #25 drive 25% of revenue)	Focus R&D and marketing on high-margin SKUs (Stock Keeping Unit).
* California (7.6K orders, $230M) vs. Northeast (lowest sales)	Replicate CA‚Äôs success in underperforming regions.
* January slump (-30% vs. annual avg.)	Launch targeted promotions to smooth cash flow.
